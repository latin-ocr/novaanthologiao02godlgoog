For some were hung with arras green and blue,
showing 1 geudy summer-mern,

Where with puffd eheek 1110 11011011 11111101 blew
His wreathed buglehorn.

One seem’d all dark and red-a 11101 01 send,
And seme 0110 pening there 110110,

Who paeed 101 ever in 1 glimmering 111111

One show’d 111 iren 0011111111 angry wavee.
You eeem’d 10 hear them 01111111 and 1111

Beneath 1111 windy wall.

By herde upon an endless plain,

The ragged rime 01 thunder brooding low,
With shadoweireaks 01 rain.

Were realms 01 upland, prodigal in 011
And hoary 10 tho wind.

And one 1 foreground blaek with stenes and slegs,
Beyond, 1 line 01 heighhS, and higher

All harr’d with long white cloud 1110 1001111111 erags,
And highest, snow and fire.

And one, 111 English home—gray twilight peur’d
011 dewy pasturas, dewy 11001,

A 11111111 ο1111010111Ρο000.
