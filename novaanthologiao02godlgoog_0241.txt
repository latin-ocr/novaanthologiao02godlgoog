226 ANTHOLOGIA

Thereat was fired . . .-no glad song

For folke to hear that wist how dire a god

Begat thia peril to them, what strong raeo
Fathered tho seaborn tongue that sang them death.

CXLIII

Ab! little think tho gay licentious proud,
Whom pleasure, power, and affluenoe surround;

They, who their thoughtloss hours in giddy mirth
And wanton, often oruel, riot waste 3-

Ah! little think they, while they danae along,
How many feel this very moment death

And all tho sad variety of pain;

How many sink in the devouring flood,

Or more devouring flame; how many bleed
By shameful varianae betwixt man and man;
' How many pine in want and dungeon glooms‚
Shut from the common air and common use
0f their own limbs; how many drink the cup
Of baleful grief or eat the bitter bread
Of misery3 sore pieroed by wintry winds
How many shrink into the sordid hut
Of ohserless poverty; how many shake
With all'the fieroer tortures of the mind,
Unbounded passion, madness‚ guilt, remorse;
How many raoked with honest passione droop
In deep retired distress3 how many stand
Around the death-bed of their dearest friends

And point the parting anguish!
