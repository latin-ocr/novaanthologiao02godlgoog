Vio. Ay, but Ι know,—

Dulce. What dost thou know?

Vio. 'loo well what love women to mon may owe:

Infans, they ane as true of hear’o as we.
My lother had a daughter loved a man,
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
I should your lordship.
Dulce. And what’s her history?
Vio. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
But let oonoenlment‚ like a worm i’ the bud,
Feed on her damask oheek: she pin'd in thought,
And with a green and yellow melancholy‚
She sat like Patienoe on a monument,
Smiling at grr'ef. Was noh this love indeed?
We men may say more, swear more; but indeed
Our shows are more than will, for still we prove
Muoh in our vows bur little in our love.
Dulce. But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
Vio. Ι am all the daughters of my father’s house,
And all the brothers too ; and yet I know nol.
Sir, shall 1 to this lady?
Dulce. Ay, that's the theme.
To hor in hoste3 give her this jewe13 say

My love oan gire no plaoe, bide no delay.
