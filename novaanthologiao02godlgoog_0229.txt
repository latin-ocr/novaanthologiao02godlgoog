And on the night
When Uther in Tintagil past away
Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two
Descending thro’ the dismal night-a night
In which tho bounds of heaven and earth were lost-
Beheld‚ so high upon the dreary deeps
It seem'd in heaven, a ship, the shape thereos
A dragon wing’d, and all from stem to stem
Bright with a shining people on the (looks,
And gone as soon as seen. And then the two
Dropt to the οονθ, and watch’d tho great sea fall,
Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,
ΤΗΙ last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep
And full of voices), slowly rose and plunged
Rmring, and all the wave was in a flama:
And down the wave and in tho flame was borne
A naked babo, and rodo to Merlin's feet,
Who stoopt and caught the babo, and oried ‘The King!
Here is an heir for Utherl’ And the fringe
Of that great bream, sweoping up the strand,
Lash'd at the wizard as he spake the word.

Ι And presently thereafter follow'd calm.
