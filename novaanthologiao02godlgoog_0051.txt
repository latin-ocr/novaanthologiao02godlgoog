Mailed aa thy heart ia with the usagee

Of pomp and power, a few short summere since
Thou wert a child, and canat not be relentleas.

O! if maternal love embraced thee then

Think of the mothere who with eyes unwet

Glare 0’er their periahing children. Haat thou ahared
The glcw cf a first friendship‚ which ie born

'Midst the rude sporta of bcyhocd‚ think cf youth
Smitten amidet ite playthinge—let the spirit

Of thine own innocent childhcod whiaper pity.

Ο enatched away in beauty’e blonm,

On thee shall prees nc ponderans tcmb,
But on thy turf shall reses rear
Their leavea, the earliest of the year,

And the wild cypreas wave in tender glcom.

And oft by yon blue guehing stream
Shall Scrrow lean her drooping head,

And feed deep thought with many a dream;
And lingering pause and lightly tread,

Fond wretcht aa if her step disturhed the dead!

Awayt we know that tears are vain,

That Death nor heeds nor heare diatreea3
Will thia unteach us tc comptam,

Or make one moumer weep the less?

And thou, who tell'st me to forget,

Thy looks ananan, thine eyes are wat
BYBON.
