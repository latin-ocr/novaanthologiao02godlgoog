Tyr. The tyrannous end bloody act is done;
The most arch deod of piteoue maeeecre
Thet ever yet thie land was guilty of.
Dighton end Forrest‚ whom Ι did suborn
To do this piece of ruthlees butehery,
Albeit they were fiesh’d villoins, bloody (loge,
Melting with tendemess and mild compassi0n‚
Wept like to children in their death'e sed story.
‘Ohl thu& quoth Dighton‚ ‘lay the gentle bahesz’
ίΤΙιυε, thue,' quoth Torrest, ‘girdling one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms:
Their lips were four red rosen on a stalli,

Which in their summer beauty kise’d eech other.

A book of prayers on their pillow lay ;

Which once,' quoth Torrest, ‘almost chang'd my mind;
But, Ο, the devil’-there the villain etopp’d3
When Dighton thus told on: ‘We smothered

The most replenished eweet work of nature,

That from the prime creation e'er she fram’d.'
Hence bothero gone with conscience end remoroe;

They could not speak3 and sc I left them both,
To bear thie tidings to the bloody king.
