18 ANTHOLOG1A

When winde that move ἰοὺ its enlm surfsee sweep

The azure sen, I love the land no more:

The smiles of the serene end tranquil deep
'Templ my unquiel mind-But when eho roar
Of ooean’s grey abyss resounds‚ and soem
Gathers upon the sea, and vast waves burst,

I lurn from lhe drear aspeoh lo the home

of earth and its deep woods, where, interspersed
When winde hlow loud, pines make sweeh melody;
Whose house is some lone berk, whose toil lhe sea,
Who'se prey the wandering fish, an evil lot

Has rhosen-Bul I my languid limhs will fling
Benealh the plene, where the brook’s murmuring

Mores lhe calm spirit but disturbs ir nol.
(ηοῗῖἰῗξω).

From fairesl oreelures we desire increase,

'l'hat thereby heauly's rose might never die,

Bul as the riper should by time decesso,

His tendor heir might beer his memory:

But thou, contraoted to thino own brighl eyes,

Foed'st thy light’s fleme wilh sslf-substantial fuel,

Making a famine where abundanoe lies,

Thyself thy foe, lo thy sweet self loo cruel.

Thou that ert now hhe world’s fresh omamenh

And only herald lo hhe geudy spring,

Within thino own bud buriest thy content

And, tendor churl, mak’st waste in niggarding.
Pity the world, or else this glullon he,

To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
