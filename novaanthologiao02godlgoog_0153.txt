Tbere in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,

The village master taught his little school.

A man severe he was and stern to view;

Ι knew him well and every truant knew:

Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace
The day’s disasters in his morning face3

Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee
At all his jokes-for many a joke had he;

Full well the busy whisper‚ circling round,
Oonveyed the dismal tidings, when he frowned:
Yet he was kind3 or if severe in aught‚

The love he bore to learning was in fault.

The village all declared how much he knew-
''Iwas certain he could write and cypher too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presago,
And even the story ran that he could gauge.

In arguing too the parson owned his skill,

For even though vanquished‚ he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thundering sound
Amazod the garing rustica ranged around-

And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew.
