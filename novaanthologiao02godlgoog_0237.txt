ANTHOLOGIA

As the sky-b1ightening south wind clears the day, ,
And makes the massed clouds roll,

The musio of the lyre, blows away

The clouds that wrop the soul.

Oh that Fato hod let me see

Thai triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre!
Thai samone, final victory

When jenlous Pan with Marsyas did conspire!
When, from iar Parnassus' side,

Young Apollo, all the pride

Of the Phrygian fluies to tame,

To the Phrygien highlsnds oame!

Where the long green need-bede sway

In ihe rippled waters grey

0f that solitory lake

Where Maeander’s springs are born3

Where the ridged pinewooded rooie

Of Messogis westwsrd break,

Mouniing westward, high ond higher.
There was held the famous strife!
