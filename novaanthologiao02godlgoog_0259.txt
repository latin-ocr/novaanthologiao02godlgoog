CLV

Sleep, angxy beauty, sleep and fear not me:

For who a sleeping lion dares provoke‘?

It shall suffice me here to sit and see

These lips shut up, that never kindly spoke:

What sight can more content a lover's mind

Than beauty sesming harmless‚ if not kind?

My words have charm’d her, for secure she sleeps‚
Though guilty much 01 wrong done 10 my love: '
And in her slumher, see! she closeeyed weeps!
Dreams often more than waking passions move.
Plead, slecp, my cause, and make her soft like thee,

That she in peace may wake and pihy me!

CLVI

He scarce had finish’d, when such murmur fill'd
Th’ assembly, as when hollow rocks retain
The sound 01 blust’ring winde, which all night long
Had rous'd the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
Sea-faring men o'erwateh'd, whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchore in a craggy bay
After the tempest: such applause was heard
As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleas’d‚
Advising peace: for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell: so much the fear
01 thnnder and the sword 01 Michael
Wrought still wihhin hhem, and no less desire
To found this nether empne, which might rise

By policy, and long process 01 time,
111 emulation opposite 10 Heav’n.
