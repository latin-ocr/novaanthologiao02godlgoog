ANTHOLOGIA

I sent thee late a roey wreath,
Not ee much honouring thee,

As giving it e hope that there
It could not withered b0;

But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’se it back to me;

Sinee when it grows, and smells, I sweer,
Not of steelf, but thee.

Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,
Unknightly‚ traitor-heartedt Woe is me!
Authority forgets a dying‘king‚
Laid widow’d of the power in hie eye
That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,
For thou, the latesel‘eft of all my knights,
In whom should meet the effiees of all,
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt3
Either from lust of gold, or like a girl
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
But, if thou spere to fling Exealibur,
I will arise and slay thee with my hande.
