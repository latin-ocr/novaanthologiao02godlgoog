From the foreste and highlands
We come, we come:
From the river-girl islande,
Where loud waves are dumb
Listening to my sweet pipinge.
'Phe wind in the reeds and rusheS,
The bees on the bells of thyme,
The birds on the myrtle busheS,
The oioele above in the lime,
And the lizards below in the grase,
Were as silent es ever old Tmolus was,
histoning to my eweel pipings.

Liquid Peneus was flowing,

And all derk Tempe lay
In Pelion’s shadow, outgrowing

The light of the dying day,

Speeded with my sweet pipinge

The Sileni end Silvano and Fauno,

And lhe Nymphs of the woods and wavee,
To the edge of the meist river-lawns,

And the brink of the dewy caveo,—
And all that ’chen did attend and follow,

Were silent with love: as you now, Apollo,

With envy of my sweet pipingsl

Ι sang of the danoing stare,
Ι sang of the deedal Earth,

And of Heaven, and the Gianl Wars,
And Leve, and Death, and Birth:
