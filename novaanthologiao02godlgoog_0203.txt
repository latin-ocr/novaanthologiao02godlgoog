Οὐράνιον μίμημα γενεθλιακοῖσιν ἐν ὥραις
τοῦτ’ ἀπὸ Νειλογενοΰς δέξο Λεωνίδεω,

Ποπποίο, Διὸς εὖνι, Σεβαστιάς· εὔαδε γάρ σοι

δῶρα τὰ καὶ λέξτρων ἄξια καὶ σοφίης.

GBEEK ANTHOIMY·

CXVII

Not him I proies, who from the world retired,
By no enlivening genereus passion fired,

On flowery couches slumbers life away

And gently bids his active powers deoay3

Who fears bright glory's awful face νο see,
And shuns renown as much as infemy:

But blest is he, who, exeroisod in cares,

To privato leisure publio virtue bears3

Who tranquil ends the reos he nobly run,

And deoks reposo with trophies labour won.
Him honour follows νο the secret obedo,

And orowns propitious his deolining heed;

In his retreat their harpe the Muses string,
For him in lays unbought spontaneous sing3
Friendship and tnrth on all his moments weit,
Pleesed with retirement better than with stato3
And round the bower where humbly great helios

Fair olives bloom‚ or vendant laurels riso.
nrrrrrror.
