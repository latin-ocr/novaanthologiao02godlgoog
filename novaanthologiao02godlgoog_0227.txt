The ev’ning cool, when he, from wrath more cccl,
Came, the mild judge and intercessor both

'l'o sentence man: the voice of (lod they heard

Now walking in the gordon, by soft winds

Brought to their ears, while day declin’d3 they heard,
And from his presence hid themselves among

The thickest trees, both man and wife, till God
Approaching thus to Adam call’d aloud.

Come, come; no time for lamentation now,

Nor much more cause; Samson hath quit himself
Like Samson, and heroically hath finish’d

A life heroic, on his enemies

Fully reveng'd3 heth left them years of monrning‚
And lamentation to the sons of Oaphtor‚

Through all Philistian bounds; to Israel

Honour hath left, and freedom‚ let but them
Find contage to lay hold on this oocasion;

'Po himself and father’s house eternal fame;

And, which is best and happiest yet, all this
With (lod not parted from him, as was fcar'd,
But favouring and assisting to the end.

Nothing is here for teate, nothing to wail

Or knock the breast ; no weakness‚ no contempt,
Dispraise, or blame; nothing but well and fair,
And what may quiet usin a death so noble.
