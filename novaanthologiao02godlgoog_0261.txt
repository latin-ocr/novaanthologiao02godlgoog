Silent and moody he went, and mueh he revolved his
disoomfort ;

He who was used to success, and to easy vietories
always,

Thus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to soorn by
a miden,

Thus to be moeked and betrayed by tho friend whom
most he had trusted!

Ah! 'twas too muoh to be borne, and he fretted and
ohafed in his armour!

‘I alone am to blame‚’ he muttered, ‘for mine was
the folly.

What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in
the harness,

Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing ·
of maidens?

’Twas but a dream-let it pass-let it vanish like so
many othersl

What I thought was a fiower, is only a weed‚ and is
worthless!

Out of my heart will I pluoh it, ond throw it away,
and henoeforward

Be but a fighter of battles‚ a lover and wooer of
dangersl’

Thus he rovolved in his mind his sorry defeat and
diseomfort,

While he was marehing by day or lying at night in
the forest,

Looking up attho trees, and the constellatione beyond
thom.
