Oh Friendship, eordial of the human breast!
So little fele, ao fervently profeseedi

Thy blosseme deek our uneuspeeting yeare3 ’
The promise of deliniens fruit appears:

Bub seen, alas, we find bhe raah mistake
Thai sanguine inexperienoe loves to make,
And view with bears the expected harvest leet,
Deoayed by time or withered by a froeb
Wheever undertakes a friend'e great part
Should be renewed in nature, pure in heart,
Prepared for martyrdom, and strong bo preve
A thousand ways the forae of genuine love.
He may be called te give up health and gain,
Te exehange content for trouble, ease fer pain,

Te eeho sigh fer sigh, and grean for grean,
And wei his eheeks with serrews net his own.

The heart of man, for such a task boo frail,
When most relied en, is mest eure to fail3

And, summoned bo parbake ite fellew’s wee,
Starte from its offiee, like a broken bow.

COWPBR.

God ef the varied bow,

God ef the thousand oyen,

From all the winde that blow,
Thy praisee riso.
