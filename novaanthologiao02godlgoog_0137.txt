ANTHOLOGIA

Or sight of vernal bloom‚ or summer’s rose,
Or flooka, orbanda, or human face divine;
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
Surrounda me, from the oheerful ways of men
Out off, and for the book of knowledge fair,
Preeented with a universal blank

of Nature’s works to me expung’d and ras’d,

And wisdom at one entranoe quite shut out.

Thou, aa a gallant berk from Albion’s coast

(The storme all weathered and the ocean orost)
Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,
Where spiees breathe and brighter seaeons smile3

There sits quiescent on the floods that show

Her beauteous form reflected olear below,

While aire iinpregnated with incense play

Around her, fanning light her streamera gay3

So thou, with seila, how swift! haet reached the shore,
Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,

And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide

Of life long since has enehored by thy aide.

But me, scarae hoping to attain that rest,

Always from port withheld, always diatreseed—-

Me howling blasts drive deviouS, tempeettossed, '
Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and eompass lost,
And day by day some ourrent’s thwarting force

Sets me more dietant from a prosperous course.
-Yet, oh! the thought that thou art safe and he 1-
That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.

GOWPER.
