Life is 1 city with many 1 street:
Dmth is the 11111111 where 111 men meet:
If life 111111 thing which gold could buy,
'l'he poor could not live and the rich would not 1111

And Phaethon they found, or what seem’d he,

Low lying in the mede, 1 oharr’d 111111 mass,
Furtow'd with 1111111111 1111 from head to foot.
Whom yet with 11111111 hands thoy lifted up

And bare him to 1111111111, and wash'd the limbs
In vain3 and, for the burnt shmds clinging to him,
Robed the 1111 form in mimont shining white.
Thon 111 the river-margo they seoop’d a grave

And laid him in the dank earth far apart,

Near to 111111111; 111 11 the dead 111 laid

Whom Zeus, the Γ1111111111, hath cut off by fim.
And on the tomb they pour’d forth wine and oil.
Nor fail’d they to 1111111 in distich (1111
How from a kingly venture kingly fall
Resulted, and 1 higher than human fame.
