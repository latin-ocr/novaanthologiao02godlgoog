01 how much more deth beauty beauteous seem

By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!

The rose looks fair, but fairor we it desm

For thot sweet odour which doth in it live.

The osnkerhlooms have full as deep a dye ³

As the perfumsd tincture of the reses,

Hang on such thorus, and play as wantonly

When summer’s breath their mesked huds disoloses:

But, for their virtue only is their show,

They live unwoo'd, and unrespeotsd fade 3

Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;

Of their sweet deaths ere sweetest odours made:
And so of you, beauteous and lovsly youth,
When that shall fade, my verse distils your truth.

The rein had fallen, the Poet arose,
Hs psss'd hythe town and out of the street,
A light wind blsw from the gates of the sun,
And waves of shadow went over the wheat,
And he sethim down in a lonely place,
And chanted a melody loud and sweet,
That made the wild-swan pause in her cloud,
And the lark drop down at his feet.
The swellow stopt os hs hunted the boe,
'I'hs snake slipt undere spray,
The wild hawk stood with the down on his book,
And stares, with his foot on the prey,
And the nightingele thought, ‘I have sung many songs,
But never a one so gay,
For he sings of what the world will bs
When the years hove died away?
