XXXIII

To me most happy therefore he appears

Who, having once, unmoved by hopes or foere,
Surveyed this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, end fleme,
Well satisfied returns from whence he came.

Is life nn hundred years or e'er so few,

’Tis repetition cll und nothing new3

A fuir, where thousands meet, but none can stay3
An inn, where trevellers buit, then post awcy3

A sea, where mun perpetually is test,

Now plunged in business, now in trifles lost:
Who leave it first, the pesceful port first gain3
Hold then, nor farther icunch into the main3

Contruct your seils; life nothing cun bestow

By long continuunce, but continued woe:

The wretched privilege dnily to deploro

The funereis of our friends, who go before;
Disesses, peine, anxieties end suares,

And ege surrounded with a thousand ceres.
