240 Awrfloroom

Oft hest thou seen bolts of the thunder hurled
As from thy threehold3 day by day haet been
A little lower than the ehilly eheen

Of icy pinnaeles3 now, ae deep profound

As these are high, descend! He ne'er is erewned
With immortality, who fears to follow

Where airy voiees lead: eo through the hollow,

'Phe silent mysteriee of earth descend 1⁹

It must be—

And yet it moves me, Romans! it eonfounds
The eounsels of my firm philosophy,

That Ruin's merossess ploughshere must pass o’er,
And barren salt be sown on yon proud eit .

As on our oliveorowned hssl we stand,

Where Kedron et our feet its scanty wetere
Distils from stone to stone with gentle motion,

As through a valley sacred to sweet peaoe,

How boldly doth it frent ust how mejeetioally!

Like a luxurious vineyord the hill-eide
Is hung with merble fabrice, line o’er line,

Terraoe o'er terrere, nearer still, end nearer

To the blue heavene.
