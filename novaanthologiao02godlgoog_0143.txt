ANTHOLOGIA

LXXIV

Behold and listen, while the fair
Breaks in sweet sounds the willing air,
And with her own breath fans the fire
Which her bright eyes do first inspiro.
What reason oen that love control

Which more than one wey oourts the soul‘?

So when a flesh of lightning falls

On our abodes, the danger eolis

For human aid, which hopes the fleme
To oonquer, though from heaven it came:
But if the winds with that conspire,

Men strive not, but deploro the fire.
wmnn.

LXXV

Like es the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
So do our minutos hasten to their end ;

anh ohanging place with that whioh goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do oontend.

Nativity, once in the main oi light,

Orewls to maturity‚ wherewith being orown’d,
Orooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,

And Time that gave doth now his gift oonfound.
Time doth transfix the flourish seton youth

And delves the parallels in beauty's brow‚

Feeds on the rarities of naturs's truth‚

And nothing stands but for his seythe to mow:

And yet to times in hope my verse shell stand,
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
