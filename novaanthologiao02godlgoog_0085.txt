ANTHOLOGIA

XL

I arise from dreams of theo
In the first sweet sloep of night,
When the winde are breathing low,

And the stare are shining bright.
I arise from dreams of thee,

And a spirit in my feet
Hath led me—who knows how?
Το thy chamber window, sweet!

The wandering aire they faint

On the dark‚ the silent stream—
The champak odours fail

Like swoet thoughts in a dream3
The nightingale’s complaint

It dies upon her heart,
As I must die on thino,

Belovtd as thou art!

0 lift me from the grass!
ldie, 1 faint, I fail!

Lot thy love in kisses rain ,
On my lips and eyelids pale.
My choek is told and white, alas!
My heart beate loud and fast:
Ο pressit close to thino again,
Where it will break at last.
