CXXVIII

Ι love, and he loves me again,
Yet dare Ι not tell who:
For if the nymphe should know my swein,
Ι feer they'd love him too:
Yet if it be not known,
The pleesure is es good ne none,
For that’s a nerrow joy ie but our own.

He is, if they een find him, fair,
And fresh and fragrant too,
As summer’e sky, or purged air,
And looks es liliee do
That are this morning blown:
Yet, yet· Ι doubt he ie not known,
And sear mueh more, thet more of him be shown.

Jonson.

Not mine own fears, nor the prophetie soul

Of the wide world dreeming on things to come,

Oen yet the leeee of my true love control,

Suppos’d es forfeit to a confin'd doom.

'I'he mortal moon heth her eclipse endured‚

And the ead eugurs mook their own presage3

Incerteintiee now erown themselves asem-ed,

And peace prooleims olives of endlese age.

Now with the drops of this most balmy time

My love looks fresh, end Death to me subscribes,

Since, spite of him, I’ll live in this poor rime,

While he insulte o'er dull end speeehless tribes:
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,

When tyrants' oreste end tombs of bross ere spent.
