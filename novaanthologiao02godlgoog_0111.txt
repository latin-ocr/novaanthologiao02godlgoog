The building woe a epooioue theatro
Half-round, on two mein pillars vaulted high,
With seete where all the lorde, end eaoh degree
0f sort, might eit in order to behold ;
The other side wee open, where the throng
On banke end eoeffolde under sky might etend3
I among these eloof obeourely stood.
'Phe feast and noon grew high, end sacrifice
Hod fill’d their hearte with mirth high eheer, ond wine,
When to their oporte they turn'd. Immediately
Was Samson ee a publio servant brought,
In their etate livery olad; before him pipee
And timbrele, on eooh eide went ermed guerde,
Both horse and foot, before him and behind,
Archere end elingere, cotephreote and speare.
At eight of him the people with a shout
Rifted the eir, elemouring their god with praiee,
Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.
He, patient, but undeunted, where they led him,
Came to the plece3 end what was eet before him,
Which without help of eye might be aesey’d
To heave, pull, drew, or break, he still perform'd
All with ineredible, stupendious foroe,
None daring to appear antagonist
