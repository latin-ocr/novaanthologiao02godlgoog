Mes ohers amin, quand je mourrai

Planiez un saule au oimeiiere:

J ’aime son feuillage eplore,

La pnleur m'en esi donee ei chere,
Et son ombre sora legere

A la terre on je dormirai.
A. DE HUSSET.

CX

I dream'd there would bo Spring no more,
Thai Nature’s ancient power was losi:

The streete were blaok with smoke and frose
They ohaiter’d irifies at tho door:

Ι wander'd from the noiey town,
I found a wood with ihorny boughs:
Ι took the thorus io bino my broWS,
I wore them like a oivic orown:

I mei with sooffn I met with sooms
From youth and babo and hoary hoirs:
They oall’d me in the publio equares
Tho fool that wears a orown of thorno:

They oall‘d me fool, they ooll'd me child:

I found an angel of the night 3

The voice was low, the look was bright3
He look’d upon my orown and smiled:

He reaoh'd the glory of a hand,
That soern’d io touch it into leaf τ
The voice was not the voioe of grief,

The words were hard to understand.
TENNYSON.
