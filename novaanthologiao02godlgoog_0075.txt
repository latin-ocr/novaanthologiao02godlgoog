All night the dreadless angel, unpursued,
Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till

mom,

Waked by the oiroling houna, with rosy hand

Unbarred the gates of light. There is a eave

’ Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,

Where light and darkness in perpetual round

Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through
Heaven ,

Grateful vicissitude, like day and night3

Light issues forth, and at the other door

Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour

To 1611 the heaven, though darkness there might well

Seem twilight here; and now went forth the mom,

Such as in highest Heaven, arrayed in gold

Empyrea13 from before her vanished night,

Shot through with orient beams; when 111 the plain,

Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,

Chariots, and fiaming arms, and fiery steeds,

Refieoting blaze on blaze, first methis view:

War he peroeived, war in prooinot; and found

Already known what he for news had thought

To have reported: gladly then he mixed

Among those friendly powers, who him received

With joy and aoclamations loud, that one,

That of so many myriads fallen yet one

Returned not lost. On to the saored hili

They led him high applauded, and present

Before the seat supreme; from whenoe a voioe,

From 'midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
