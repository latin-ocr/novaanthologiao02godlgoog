LXIV

Forsake me not thus, Adam; witness Heav'n
What love sineere, and reverenoe in my heart
Ibear thee, and unweeting have offended,
Unhappily deoeiv'd; thy suppliant
Ι beg, and olasp thy knees ; bereave me not,
Whereon I live, thy gentle looksr, thy aid,

Thy oounsol in this uttermost distress‚

My only strength and stay: forlorn of thee,
Whither shall Ι betake me, where subsist? ·

While yet we live, soaroe one short hour perhaps,
Between us two let there be poaoe; both joining,
As join’d in injuries, one enmity

Against a foe by doom express assign’d us,

That oruol Serpent; on me exorciso not

Thy hatred for this misery befall’n;

On mo already lost, mathan thyself

More miserable.

LXV

Weep no more, nor sigh, nor grona,
Sorrow calls no time that’s gone:
Violots pluolred‚ the sweetest rain
Makes not fresh nor grow again3
Trim thy looks, loolr oheorfully,

· Fate’s hidden ends eyes cannot see.
J oys as winged dreams fiy fast,
Why should sadness longer last?
Grief is but a wound to woe,

Gentlest fair, mourn, mourn no moe.
J. rancum.
