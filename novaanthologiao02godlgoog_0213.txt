Fether‚ sorbent: for Ι but meet loday
The doom that et my birth was written down
In Hoeven, and thou erl Heeven's nneonseious hend.
Surely my henrl eried out that il wne thou,
When firel Ι sew lhee ; end thy hearl spoke loo,
Ι know it: but Fale trod those promplings down
Under its iron heel; Fale, Pele engaged
'I'he strife, end hurled me on my father’s speer.
But let us speek no more of this: Ι find
My father3 lel me feel that Ι have found.
Come, sil beside meon this send, end take
My head between thy hands, and kiss my eheeks,
And wash them with thy teate, and say, ‘My Son !'
Quiokl quiekl for numbered ere my sends of life,
And swift3 for like the lightning to this field
Ι came, end like the wind 1 go away-
Sudden and swifl, and like a passing wind.
But il was writ in Heeven that this should be.

Ι burst the chain, I sprung into the boel.

Seven days I drove along the dreery deep,

And with me drove the moon end all the stars3
And the wind fell, end on the seventh night

Ι heard the shingle grinding in the surge,

And felt ihe bost shock earth, and looking up,
Behold‚ the enehanted lowers of Carbonek,

A caslle like e roek upon a rock‚

With dhaem-like portale open to the see,

And steps that met lhe breeker; there was none
