For ending thee no sooner. Thou hest nor youth nor age:

But, as it were, an aiterdinner’s sleep

Dreaming on both; 101 all thy blessed youth

Beeomes as aged and doth beg the alms

01 palsied eld: and when thou art old and rieh

Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb‚ nor beauty,

To make thy riohes pleasant. What ’s yet in this
. That bears the name 01 Life? Yet in this Life

Lie hid moe thousand deaths. Yet Death we sear,

That makes these odds all even.

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do ohange:
Thy pyramide built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange3
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told,
Thy registers and thee 1 both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past,
For thy reeords and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by thy continual haste.
This 1 do verr, and this shall ever be;
I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.
