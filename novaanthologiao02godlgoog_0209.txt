CXXII

To me most happy therefore he appears

who, having once, unmoved by hopes or seara,

Surveyed this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, and fleme,

Well satisfied returns from whenee he came.
Is life an hundred years or e’er so few,

’Tis repetition all aud nothing new3

A fair, where thousauds meet, but none ean stay3

An inu, where travellers bait, then poet away;
A sea, where man perpetually is tost,

Now plunged in business now in trifles lost:
Who leave it first, the peaoeful port first gain;
Hold then, nor further launeh into the maiu3
Contraet your sails3 life nothing can bestow
By long continuanoe, but continued woe:

The wretched privilege daily to deplere

The funerals of our friends, who go before 3
Diseases‚ paine, anxieties and suares,

And age surrounded with a thousand cares,
