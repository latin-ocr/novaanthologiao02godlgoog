And Ι 11111 lay thee in that lovely earth,

And heap a stately mound above thy bones,

And plant a far-seen pillar over ali,

And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.

And I will spere thy host; yea, let them gol
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
What should I do with slaying any more?

For would that all whom I have ever elain
Might be 01100 111010 alive3 my bitterest foss,
And they who were eall’d ohampions in their time,
And through whose death I won that fame Ι have,
And Ι were nothing but a eommon man,

A poor, mean soldier, and without renown;

So thou mightest live 100, my son, my sont

Or rather would that Ι, even I myself,

Might now be lying on this bloody sand,

Near death, and by an ignorant stroke 01 thino,
Not thou 01 1111110, and I might die, not thou;
And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan3

And Zal might weep above my grave, 1101 thine3
And say: ιΟ son, Ι weep thee not too sore,

For willingly‚ I know, thou met’st thine end t'
But now in blood and battles was my youth,
And full 01 blood and battles is my age,

And Ι shall never end this 1110 01 blood.
