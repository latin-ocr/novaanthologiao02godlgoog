Why do I love this man? My country’s daughters

Love none but heroes But I have no country!
'Phe slave 111111 lost all, save her bonds I love him;

And that ’s the heaviest link of the long chain—

To love whom we esteem not Be it so:
The hour is coming when he 'll need all love,

And find none. Το 1111 from him now were base'r
Thon to have stabb'd him on his throne when highest
Would have been noble in my country’s creed:

Ι was not made for either. Could Ι save him,
I should not love 11111 better, but myself3
And Ι have need of the last, for I have fallen

ln my own thoughts, by loving this soft strangcr.

BYROK.

Not from the stars do Ι my judgement pluck;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luok,
Of plagues, of dearths, or sessons’ quality3
Nor can Ι fortune to brief minutos tell,
Pointing to esch his thunder‚ rain, and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well,
By ott predict that I in heaven find:
But from thino eyes my knowledge Ι derivo,
And, consenserere, in them I resd such 111
Α1 ‘Truth and heauty shall together thrive,
If from thyself to storo thou wouldst convert3’
Or else of thee this I prognosticatet
‘Thy endis truth's and beauty's doom aud date?
