The forward violet thus did I chide:
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that

If 1101110111 my love’s breath? The purple pride
Which on thy 0011 cheek 101 complexion dwells
In my love’s veina thou haet 100 groeely dyed.
The lily I condemned 101 thy hand,
And bude 01 marjoram had stol'n thy hair; r

And to hie robbery hid annex'd thy breath3

Yet hold me not 101 ever in thine Eaet:

How can my nature longer mix with thine‘?
Ooldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold

Α10 all thy lignes, and cold my wrinkled feet
Upon thy glimmering threeholde, when the steam
Flecte up 110111 those dim fields about the homes

01 happy men thet have the power to die,
And graasy barrows 01 the happier dead.
