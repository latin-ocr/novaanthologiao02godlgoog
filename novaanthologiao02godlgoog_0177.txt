Set where the upper streame of Simois flow

Was the Palladium, high 'mid rook and wood;
And Heotor was in Ilium, far below,

Andlought, ond saw it noh—but there it stood!
It stood, and sun and moonehine reinod their light
On the pure columns of ils glou-built hell,
Baekword and forward rolled 'ohe waves of fight
Round Troy-but while this stood, Troy oould not fell.
So. in ils lovely moonlight, lives tho soul.
Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air3

Oold, plashing posi it, crystel wetere roll 3

We visit it by momente, eh, too rare!

We shall ronow the battle on the plain
Tomorrowt-red with blood will Xanthus be;
Hector and Ajax will be there again,

Helen will oome upon the walls io see.

still doth the soul from its lone fastuose high
Upon our life a ruling effluenee send3

And when it soils, fight as we will, we dio ;

And while it laste, we cannot wholly end.

XCVII

Seli-reverence, seli-knowledge, sels-control,

These three alone lond life lo sovereign power.
Yet not for power-power of itself

Would eome unoalled for-but to live by law,
' Aeting the law we live by, without fear:
And beoause right is right, to follow right

Were wisdom‚ in the soorn of consequence.
Temseu.
