The Danube 10 the Severn gave
The darken'd 110011 that beai no mere;
They laid him by 1110 pleasant shore,
And in the hearing of 1110 wave.

There twice a day the Severn fills3

The sali sea-waher passes by,

And hushes half 1110 babbling Wye,
And makes a silence in the hills.

, The Wye is hush’d nor moved along,
And hush’d my deepesi grief ef all,
When fill'd with tears thal cannot fall,

Ι brim with sorrow drowning song.

The tide flows down, the wave again ’
10 vocal in its wooded walls3
My deeper snguish also falls,

And I ean speak a 111110 111011.

The Autumn skies are flushed with gold,
And fair and bright the rivers run;

These are bui streame of winter sold,
And painted misis that queneh 1110 sun.

In secret beughs ne sweet birds sing,
In secret boughs no bird ean shreud;

These are but leaves that take 10 iring,
And wintry winds 11111 pipe so lond.

'Tis 1101 trees' shade, bul: eloudy glooms
Thai 011 1110 eheerless valleys fau3
The flewers are in their grassy tombs,
And hears el (lew are 011 thern all.
