‘Spooh² 1 love thee besti'
Η9 exolaimed:

‘Lei thy love my own loretell,’
I oonfessed:

‘Olosp my heurt on thine
Now unblamod,

Sinoe upon thy soul as well
Hungeth mino 1’

Wus it wrong to own,
Being trun?
Why should all the giving prove
His alone?
I hod wealth and esse,
Beauly, youth:
Since my lover gave me love
1 gave those.

Thai wus oll I meant,
-Το bo just,

And the passion I had raised
To content.

Sinoe he ehose to ohsnge
Gold for duel,

If I gave him what he praised
Wes it strange?

Would he lovod 1119 yet,
On and on,

While I found some way undreemed,
-Peid my debi!

Grave moro life und more,
Τί11, ull gone,

He should smile ‘she never seemed
Mine before.
