He searoehed said, when the bare earth, till then
Desert and bare, dnsightly, unadomed,

Brought forth the tonder grass, whose verdnre olad

“ Her universal faoe with pleasant green3

Thon herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered‚

Opening their various oolours, and made gay

Her bosom, smslling swoet; and, these soaroe blown,

Forth tlourished thiok the olustering vine, forth orept

The swelling gourd, up stood the eorny reed

Embattlod in her field, and the humble shrub,

And bush with frizzled hair implicit: last

Roas, as in danos, the stately trees, and spread

Their branohes hung with eopious fruit, or gemmed

Their blossoms. With high woods the hills were
orowned

With tufts the valleys and eaoh fountain side,

With borders long the rivers: that Earth now

Seemed like to Hoeven, a seat where Gods might
dwsll,

Or wander with delight, and love to haunt

Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained

Upon the earth, and man to till the ground

None was; but from the earth a dewy mist

Went up, and watered all the ground, and saoh

Plant of the field3 whioh, ere it was in the earth,

God made, and every herb, before it grew

On the green stem. God saw that it was good:

So even and morn recorded the third day.
