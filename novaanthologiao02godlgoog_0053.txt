He looked, and scw wide territory spread

Before him, towns, and 10111 werke between,
Oities 01 men with lofty gates and towers,
Ooncourse in arms, ‘fieroe 11000 threatening war,
Giants 01 mighty bone and bold emprise.

Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,
Single, or in array 01 battle renged

Both horse and 1001, 1101 idly mustering stood;
One way 1 bend select from forcge drives

A herd 01 1100100, fair oxen and 1111 111110,

From 1111 meadow ground, or fleecy 110011,
Ewes and their blesting lambs, over the plain,
Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly,
But 0111 111 aid, which makes 1 bloody fray3
With cruel tournament the squadrons join3
Where cattle pastured 1110, now 0011101οἁ lies
With 011010εο0 and 111110 the cnsanguined field,
Desertedt others to 1 city strong

Lcy siege, encamped ; by battery, scale and mine
Aesculting: others from the wall defend

With dart and jevelin, stenes, and sulphureus fire;
On ecch hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
