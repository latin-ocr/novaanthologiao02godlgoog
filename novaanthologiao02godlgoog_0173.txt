ANTHOLOGIA

Forth through the world they go,

Hymning to all below,

Thoe, whom the blest shall know,
Lord of the skieel

Ronding the hostile town,
Smiting the godloes hosts3
Hurling the demone down
To the dreer coesto
still with thy lightning frown
Winning thee wide renown,
Tffl the wild walens drown
All their proud boeste

nol m malim.

Menoeceus, thou hest oyen and Ι oen hear

Too plainly what full tides of onsel sap

Our sevon high gotes, and what e weight of wer
Rides on those ringing exlesl jingle of bibe,
Shouls‚ arrowe, tramp of the hornfoobed horse
Theb grind bhe glebo to powderl Stony ehowers
Oi that eanetunning hail of Ares orash

Along the sounding walls. Above, below,

Shook after shook, the song-built towers and gotes
noel, bruised and butted with the shuddering
War·thunder of iron-rame3 ond from within

The eity eomes a murmur void of joy,

Lesb she be taken captive—maidens, wives,
And mothers with their bebblers of the down,
And oldest ege in shadow from the night,

Folling about their shrinos before their (lodo,
And weiling ‘Save us?
