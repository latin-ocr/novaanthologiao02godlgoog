Oh,
My Godl Cen it be possible I have
To die so suddenly? so young to go
Under the obscure, eold, rotting‚ wormy ground?
To be nailed down into a norrow plece3
Το see no more sweet sunshine; hearne more
Blithe voice of living thing; muse not again
Upon familior thoughts-sed, yet thus lost!
How feerful! To be nothing! or to be-
Whot? Or where em I? Iret me not go med!
Sweet Heaven, forgive weok thoughts l If there should be
No God, no heaven, no earth, in the void world,
'Phe wide, grey, lampless deep, unpeopled worldl
Ii ull things then should be my father’s spirit,
His eye, his voice, his touch, surrounding me,
The otmosphere end breeth oi my dead life!

If sometimes as a shupe more lilio himself,

Even the form whieh tortured me on earth,

Mosked in grey heire end wrinkles he should oome,
And wind me in his hellish arms, und fix

His eyes on mine, and drag me down, down, down!
For was he not alone omnipotent

On earth, and ever present? Even though dead
Does not his spirit live in all thet breethe,

And work for me end mine still the some ruin,

Seorn, pain, despair?
emitur.
