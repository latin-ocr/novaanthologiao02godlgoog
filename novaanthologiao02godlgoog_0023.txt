Lot your shows be new es strange,

Let them oft and eweetly very:
Lot them haste so to their change

Ae tho seers may not tarry.
Τοο long t’ expeet the pleesing’st sight
Doth take away from the delight
All seur and sullen looks away,
That are the servants of the day:
Our sports ere of the humorous Night,
who feeds the stare that give her light,
And useth than her wont more bright,
Το help the Vision of Delight.
See, see, her seeptro and her erown
Are all of fleme, and from her gown
Α train of light eomes waving down.
This night in dew she will not steep
The brein, nor loek the sense in sleep:
But ell awake with phantoms keep,
And those to make Delight more deep.
