Then saw they how there hove a dueky berge,
Black as a funeral eearf from stem to stem,
Beneath them3 end deseending they were were
That all the deeks were dense with stately forms,
Black-etoled, blank-hooded‚ like a dream-by these
Three Queens with erewns of gold: and from them rose
A cry that ehiver'd to the tingling stem,
And, as it were one voice, an agony

Of lamentation‚ like a wind that ehrille
All night in a waste land, where no ene eomes,

Or heth come, since the making ef the world.

Life! I know not what thou art3
But know that thou and Ι must part;
And when or how or where we met,

I own, to me 's a secret yet

Life! we 've been long together

Through pleasant and through eloudy weether3
”ris hard to part when friends ere dear-
Perhaps 'twill eost a sigh, atear:
Then eteel away—give little warnIng:

Cheose thine own time:
Sey not ‘good night‚' but in some brighter elime

Bid me ‘good morning!
