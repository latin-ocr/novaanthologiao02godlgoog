ANTHOLOGIA

Men that but one Saint odore,

Make a show of love to more;

Beeuty must be soorned in none,
'Phough but truly served in one:

For what is courtehip but disguise?
'l'rue hearts may heve dissembling eyes.

Men, when their affairs require,

Must ewhile themselves retire:
Sometimes hunt and sometimes hawk‚
And not everoit and talk:

If these and suoh-like you oen beer,

Then like and love, aud never fearl
Τ. onnon.

1.111

'Phe world is too much with us 3 late and soon
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers3
Little we see in Nature that is ours:
We heve given our heerts away, e sordid boon!
The sea thot hares her bosom to the moon,
The winde that will be howling et all houns
And are upgethered now like sleeping flowers—
For this, for everything‚ we ere out of tune:
It moves us not. Greet (lodi I’d rather be
A Pegnn, suckled in a oreed outworn:
So might Ι, standing on this pleasant les,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn,
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,

Or hear old Triton blow his wreethed hornl
womwom.
