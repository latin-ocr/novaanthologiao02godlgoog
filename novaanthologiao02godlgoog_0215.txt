Stood 000111 but a lion on 00011 side

That kept the entry, and the moon was full.

Then from the boat 1 leapt, and up 1110 010110;
There drew my swerd. With sudden-flaring 11101100
Τ11000 two great beasta 1000 upright like a 111011,

anh gript a shoulder‚ 01111 1 stood between.

Ο ancient streame, 0 far-deseended woods‚

Full of the fluttering of melodioua 001110;

Ο hills and valleys that adorn yourselves

In solemn jubilation3 winda and 01011110,

Ocean and land in stormy nuptiale olasped,

, And all exuberant creaturos that acolaim

The earth's divine renewa13 lol I too

With youra would mingle somewhat 01 glad aong;
Ι 100 have 001110 through wintry terrore-yon,
Through tempest and through eatae-lyam of 00111
¹Have 001110 and am delivered. Me the Spring,
Me also dimly with new life hath touched

And with regenerato hope, the salt of life3

And I would dedicate these grateful 10010

To whatsoever power beneficent-

Veiled though his oountenanoesundivulged his thought-
Hath led me from the haunted darkness forth

Into the graoious air and 1011101 1110111,

And 01111010 me to know my spirit a 11010

0111110 great 01101110, 0110 with bird and 01100111

And voieeful mountain.
