CLXXI

But oh, that deep romantio chasm which slanted
Dcwn the green hill athwarh a cedarn cover!
A savagc place, ae hely and enchanted
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman weiling for her demon lover.
And from this chasm‚ with ceaselese turmoil seething‚
Ae if thie earth in fast thick pente were breathing,
A mighty feuntain momcnhly was forced:
Amid whose navist, half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments raulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher'eflai13
And ’mid these dancing rocks at cnce and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the carerns measureless tc man,
And sank in tumult to a liseless ocean:
And 'mid thie tumult Kubla heard from far
Anceetral voices prophesying war.
