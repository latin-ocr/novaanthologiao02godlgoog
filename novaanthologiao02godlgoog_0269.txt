Let 1101 my cold words here accuse my zeul:
’ris nottho trial of a woman's war,
'l'he bilior clamour of two eager tongues,
Oen arbitrale this cause betwixt us twuin3
The blood is 1101 that must be cool'd for this:
Yel can ¹I 1101 of such lame patience boasl
As 10 be hush'd and naught al all 10 say.
11101, the fuir mverence of your highness curbo me
From giving reins and spurs 10 my free speech3
Which else would post unlil it had return'd
These terme of treeson doubled down his 1111001
Setting aeide his high blood's royally,
And 101 him be no kinsman 10 my hege,
I do defy him, and I epil at him ;
call him a slanderous coward end a villain:
Which 10 maintain I would allow him odds‚
And meet him, were I tied 10 run ufoot
Even 10 the frozen ridges of 1110 Alps,
Or any 011101 ground inhabitable‚
Where ever Englishman dursl 001 his foot.
Moundme let this defend my loyally:
By ull my hopee most felsely deth he lie.
