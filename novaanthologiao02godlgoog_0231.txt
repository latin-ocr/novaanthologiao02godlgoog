But, children, at midm'ght,
When soft the winde blow,
When eleer falls the moonlight,
When spring-tides are low;

When sweet aire come seeward

From heathe starred with breem,
And high rocks throw mildly

On the blanched sande a gloom3
Up the still, glietening beaehes,
Up the ereeke we will hie,

Over banks of bright seaweed
The ebhtide leaves dry.

We will gaze, from the send-hille,
At the white, sleeping tewn;

At the ehureh on the hill-side-
And then come back down.
Singing: ‘There dwells a leved one,
But erue] is she!

She left lonely for ever

The kings ef the see'

CXXXVIII

Unknown thou art3 yet thy fieree vaunt is vein.

Thou dost not slay me, proud end boastful men.
No! Rustum elays me, end this filiel heert.

For were Ι matehed with ten euch men es thou,
And I were he who till te-day I wne,

They should be lying here, I standing there.
