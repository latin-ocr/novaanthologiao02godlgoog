OPetriot Statesmon, be thou wise to know

The limito of resistonoe, ond the bounds
Determining oonoession; still be bold

Not only to slight proise, but suffer soorn:
And be thy heart a fortress, to mointoin

The day against the moment, ond the year
Agrinst the day: thy voice, a musio, heard
Through all the yells ond oounteryells of feud
And faotion3 and thy will, a power to moko
This everehanging world of circumstante

· In changing, ohime with neverohanging Low.

Peooe to all suohl But were there one whose fires
True genius kindles, end fair fame inspires;

Blest with eooh taleni end eaoh ort to plesse,

And born to write, converse, and live with ease:

Should suoh a man, too fond to rule alone,
Beer, like the Turk, no brother neor the throne,

View him with soomful, yet with jealous eyes,
And hate for erts thet oeused himself to rise;
Damn with faint praise, essent with oivil loer,
And, without snsering, teaoh the rest to sneer; ·
