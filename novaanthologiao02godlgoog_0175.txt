But she, 'midst foer, behold hie kind grey eyeS,
And then, 11 hope eume glimmering through 1111 dread,
In 1 weuk voice he eoeroe could 11111 she said:

0 Doath‚ isthou huet risen from the eeu,
Sent by the gods to end this misery,
I thank them that thou oomest in this form3
Who rather thought 1ο soe a hideous worm
Oome trailing up the sends from out the deep,
Or suddenly owing over from the steep
To lep me in his folds, and bone by bone
ν Orush ell my body: eome then, with no moun
Will I make ready now to leave the light.
But yet thy 1111 is wonderful und bright.
Art thou 1 god‘? Ah, then be kind to me.
Ie there no velley 111 off from 1111111,
Where Ι may h've ulone, ufar from etrite,

Nor anger any god with my poor life?

Or do the gode delight in misery‚
And 111 thou oome to mook me ere I die?
