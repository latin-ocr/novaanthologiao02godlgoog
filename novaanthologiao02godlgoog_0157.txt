Birds in the high Han-garden
When twilight was falling,
Mami, Maud, Maud, Maud‚
They were erying and calling.
Where was Maud? in our w00d;
And Ι, who else, was with her,
Gathering woodland filies,
Myrieds blow together.

Birde in our woed sang
Ringing thro' the velleyS,

Maud is here, here, here
In among the lilios.

I kiss’d her slender hand,
She took the kise sedately ;
Maud is not seventeen,

But she is tell end stately.

Ito ery out 011 pride
Who have won her favour!
Ο Maud were sure of heaven
If lowliness eeuld save her.

I know the wey she went

Home with her maiden poey,
For her feet have touch’d the meedows
And left the daieies rosy.

Birds in the high Hell·garden
Were erying and calling te her,

Where is Maud, Meud, Maud?
One is come to woo her.

hook, a horse at the door,
And little King Charley snarling,
Ge back, my lord, across the moer,
You ere not her derling. mnemon.
