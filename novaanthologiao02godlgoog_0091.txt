ANTHOLOGIA

XLIII

Woods‚ that wave o'er Delphi's sheep,

Isles‚ that orown th’ Egeean deep,
Fields, that eool Ilissus leves,
Or where Maeander’s amber weves
In lingering Leb’rinths omep,
How do your tuneful Eehoes languish,
Mute, but to the voice of Anguish‘?
Where each old poetio Mountain
Inspiration breeth'd eround:
Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain
Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:
'sill the sed Nine, in Groeoe’s evil hour,
Left their Parnassus for the Letian plains.
Alike they soorn the pomp of tyrent Power,
And oowerd Vioe, that revels in her ohains.
- When Latium hod her lofty spirit lost,
They sought‚ oh Albion! next thy seeenoiroled eoest.

GRAY.
