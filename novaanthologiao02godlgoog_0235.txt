ANTHOLOGlA

CXL

Ofountuins, when in you shullI
Mysolf‚ oosod of unponoeful thoughts, enpy‘?
ofields! Owoodsl when, when shall I be made
Tho happy tonant of your shude?

Hero ’s tho spring-hond of Plousuro's flood;
Whoro ull tho richen lie, that she
Has ooin’d and stnmp’d for good.

Prido and Ambition hem

Only in far-feloh’d metaphors appear:

Horo nought but winds oon hurtful murmure scallor,
And nought but Echo fiullor.
Tho Gods, when lhoy descondod, hilhor

From Heovon did always ohooso their way;

And lhomforo we moy boldly say

Thut 'lis tho way too thither.

How happy hero should Ι
And one deor She live and embrnoing die!
Sho who is all the world, and oon excludo

In deserte solitudo.

I should have then this only soar,
Lest men, when they my pleusures soe,
Should all como im'talo mo,

And so make a city horo.
