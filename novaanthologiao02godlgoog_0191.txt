0 llort, vieux capitiine, il est tempe, levcne l’ancrel
ce pays nous ennuie‚ ὁ liert! Appereillonel
Si le ciel et le mer eont noire comme de l’encre‚
Noe coeure que tu connais eont templis de raycns!
Vereenoue ton poison, pour qu'il noue reconforte!
Nous verdone, tant oe feu noua brule le cerveau,
Plonger au fond du gouffre, Enfer ou (liel, qu’importe‘?

Au fond de l’Inconnu pour trouver du mareau!

We must look the possibility cf failure firmly in the
face, and consider well that the Power we attaok ie great
and the intelligence which guidee it vigorem, that the
contest ie begun lese in regard tc the probability of
success thnn to the certainty that without it destruction
is not to be avoided, and that we dc our duty better
by our own age and the next and by the honour of the
king and naticn iu falling with arms in cur hande, than
in patiently wrffering ourselvee to be fettered and held
in chaine. We must make curselves familiar with the
thought of every kind of sacrifice and of death if we
would tread the path now proposed. Thus prepared
internally and favoured by circumstances, let us begin in
Ged’s name and remember that by eourage and fortitude
great ende have been reached with small means. Only
we must be rid of all languid wretched creaturos that are
insensible to noble feelings and incapable of any kind
of devotion and sacrifice, people who mar end spcil
everything and think of nothing but the quiet enjcyment

cf their miserable existence.
