That same night both priest and sege
Died seeursed in sombre rege.

Never more in wild wood green

Was that glorious Goddess seen.

Never more: audirem that day

Eril hap and dull deeey

Fell on countryside and town:

Life and vigour dwindled down:
Sterms in spring nipped bud end sprout,
Summer suns shed plague and drought,
Autumn’s stere was crude and scant,
Winter snews beleaguered want:

Vines were blselr at vintage tide,
Flecks and herds of murrein died:
Fishing beate same empty home,

Good ships foundered in the feam:
Haggard tradere lost all heart
Wandering through the empty mart:
For the eir hung thick with gloem‚

Silenee, and the sense of doom.
J. mouson.

Never love unless you ean

Beer with all the faults elman!

Men sometimes will jealous be,

Though but little cause they see,

And hang the head ss discertent,

And speek what straight they will repent.
