XXXI

Thou think’et ’tis much that this eontentioue etorm
Invades us to the ekin: eo ’tis to thee3
But where the greater maledy ie fix’d‚

The lesser ie sceree felt. Thou'dst shun a bear3

But if thy ssight lay toward the roaring see,
Thou’dsss meess the bear i’ the mouth. When the mind ’e

free
The body ’s delieete; the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
. Save whess beate there. Filial ingratitudo!

¹ Is it not es this mouth should tear this hand

For lifting foed to’t? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In suoh a night

'Po shue me out! Peur ους Ι will endure.

In such a night ae thiel ORegem Generil!

Your old kind father, whose frenk heare gave all,-
01 that way madness lies; less me ehun thet3

No more of that.
