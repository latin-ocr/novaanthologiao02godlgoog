Heaven lies about usin our inlaney.

Shades of the prisonhouse begin to elose
Upon the growing Boy:

But he beholds the light, and whenee it flows
He sees it in his joy:

The Youth who daily further from the East
Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,
And by the vision splendid
Is on his way attended:

At length the Man pereeives it die away,

And fade into the light of common day.

The lights begin to twinlde from the roeks:
The long day wanes: the slow moon elimbs: the deep
Moans round with many voioos. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

Push off, and sitting well in order amite

The sounding furrows3 lor my purpose holds

To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

Of all the western stars, until I die.

It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

11 may be we shall touch the Happy Isles‚

And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho'

We are not now that strength whioh in old days
Moved earth and heaven ; that whieh we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroie hearts,

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

Το strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
