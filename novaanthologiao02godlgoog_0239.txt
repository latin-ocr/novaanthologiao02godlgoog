But not long
Had the fresh ware of windy fight begun
Hearing, and al] the surge of swords to sway,
When timeless night laid hold of heaven, and took
With ita great gorgo the noon as in a gulf,
Strangled; and thioker than the shrill·winged shafts
Flew the fleet lightnings . . . that our host,
Smit with siok presage of some wrathful God
Quailed‚ but the foe aa from one iron throat
With one great sheer sole thousand-throated cry
Shook earth, heartstaggered from their shout, and olove
The eyeless hollow of heaven3 and breaohed therewith
As with an onset of strength-shattering sound
The rent vault of the roaring noon of night
From her throned seat of usurpation rang
Reverberate answer3 such response there perled
As tho’ the tide's charge of a storming sea
Had buret the sky's wall, and made broad a breaoh
In the ambient girth and bastion flanked with stara
Guarding the fortresa of the Gods, and all
Orashed now together on ruin3 and through that cry
And higher above it oeasing one man’s note
Tore ite way like a trumpet: Charyo, malco ead,
aaarye, hott not, etrite, rorat ap their strength bytho rootr,
Stra'lae, break thom, mate your birthrr'ytt’a promise eure,
Show your reare tardior thara tto forced laad treats,

Sors of tte seo'a aaaron and all ears that heard
Rang with that fiery ary, that the fine air
