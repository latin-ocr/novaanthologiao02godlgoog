LXVIII

In vaine do men
Tho heavens of their fortune’s fault aeonae,
Sith they know best what is the best for them:
For they to eaoh suoh fortune doe diffuse
As they doe know oaoh oan most aptly uso.
For not that which men oovet most is best,
Nor that thing worst which men doe most refuse3
But fittost is that all oontonted rest

With what they hold3 eaoh hath his fortune in his
broast.

LXIX

Yet nottho more
Cease I to wander where the musas haunt
Cloar spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song: but ohief
Thea, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallow’d feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
Those other two equall’d with me in fato,
So were I equall’d with them in renown
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,
And Tiresias and Phineus, propheta old.
Thon seed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers3 astho wakoful bird
Singa darkling, and in shadiest eovert hid
Tunes her nootmnal note. Thus with the year

Seasons return3 but not' to mo returns
Day‚ or the sweet approach of ev’n or morn,
