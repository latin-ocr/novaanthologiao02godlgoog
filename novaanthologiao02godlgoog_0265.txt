Fer. This is strango: your father 's in somo passion

'Phat works him strongly.
Miro. Novor till this day
Saw Ι him touoh’d with angor so distempor'd.
Pro. You do look, my son, ina movod sort,
As if you were dismay’d: bo oheerful, sir:
Our rovels now am ended. These our octors,
As I forotold you, were all spirits and

And, like the basoloss fabrio of this vision,

Tho solemn templos, tho great globo ilsoll]
Yon, all which it inhorit, shall dissolvo
’ And, like this insubstantial pagoanl fadod,
Leave not a rael< behind. We aro such oluff
As dreams aro made on, and our little life

Is rounded with a oloop.
