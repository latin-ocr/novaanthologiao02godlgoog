0111

Soon the essembly‚ in 0 011010 renged
Stood silent round the shrine: each look was changed
To sudden veneration: women meek
Beokon’d their sons to silenoe ; while eeeh oheek

Of virgin bloom pnled gently for slight 1001.
Endymion too, without 0 101001 peer,

Stood‚ wan, and pule, and with 011 owed 1000,
Among his brothers of the mountain ohsse.

In midst 01011, 111010110101110 priest

Eyed them with joy from greatest 10 the least,
And, 01101 lifting up his aged hands,

Thus spake he: ‘Men of Latmos! shepherd hands!
Whose 00101110 to guard 0 thousand fiooks:
Whether deseended from beneath the rocks

Thet overtop your mounteins3 whether 001110

From velleys where the pipe is never dumb3

Or from your ewelling (towns, where sweet 011 01110
Blue here-belle lightly‚ and where priokly furno
Buds 1011011 gold3 or ye‚ whose preoious charge
Nibble their fill 01 ooeen's very margo,

Whose mellow reeds 010 touoh'd with sounds forlorn
Bytho dim eohoes of old Γ11110110 horn:

Mothers end wives! who day by day prepare

The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;
And all ye gentle girls who foster up

Udderless lambe, end in 0 little oup

Will put ohoioe honey for 0 favour'd youth:

Yea, every one attend! 101111 good truth

Our vows 010 wanting 10 our great god Pon.
