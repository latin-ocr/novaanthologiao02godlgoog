ANTHoLOGm

Svreeter thy 10100, but every sound is sweet;
Myriads 01 rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
The moan of dores 111 immemoris] elms,

And murmuring 01 innumerable bees.

K. Hera Who hath sent thee now?
Meet. The constable 01 Franoe.
K. Han. I pray thee, bear my former answer baok:
Bid them aohieve me and then sell my bones,
Good Godt why should they moek poor follows'thus‘?
The man that 01100 did sell the lion's skin
While the beast liv’d, was kill’d with hunting him.
A many 01 our bodies shall no doubt ¹
Find native graves ; upon the whioh, I trust,
Shall witness live 111 brass of this day’s work;
And those that leave their valiant bones in Franco,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be fam’d ; 101 there the sun shall greet
them,
And dravv their honours reeking up to heaven.

Let me speak proudly: tell the constable,
We are but warriors 101 the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmiroh'd
With rainy marching in the painful field ;
There’s not a pieoe 01 feather in our host—

Good argument, I hope, we vvill not fly-
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.
