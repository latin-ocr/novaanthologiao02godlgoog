But that beleved nome unnerved my arm-

That name, and something, I confess-in thee
Which troubles all my heart, and made my shiold
Tall; and thy spesr transfixed an unarmed foe.
And now theu boastest, and insult’st my fate.
But hear theu this, fieree man; tremble te hear!
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!

My father, whom Ι seek through all the world,

He shall avonge my death, and punish thee.

CXXXIX

A time there was, ere England's griefs began,
When every rood ef ground maintained its man.
Fer him light labeur spread her wholesome stere,
Just gave what life required, but gave no more.
His best companions innocense and health

And his best rio-hes igneranoe ef weolth.

But times are altered trade's unieeling traiu
Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain

Aleng the lawn where soattered hamlets rese,
Unwieldy wealth and eumbrous pomp repose;
And every want te epulones allied,

And every paug that folly pays to pride.

These gentle hours that plenty bade te bloom,
These calm desines that asked but little reem,
These healthful sperts that graced the peaeeful soene,
Lived in eaeh look, and brightened all the green,
These far departing seek a kinder shore,

And rural mirth and manners are ne mere.
