You seo mo hore,

As 019 of you nath said, an old, unarm’d‚
Defenoeloss man3 and yostordoy you saw mo
Presiding in 1119 hall of duool 91919,

Apparent sovoroign of our hundred 19199,
Robod in offioial purple, dealing out

Tho edicto of a power whioh is 10111119,
Nor yours‚ but of our masters-tho patriciano.

Why Ι was 111919 you know, or think you know;
Why Ι am here ho who hath beon most wrong'd,

Η9 who among you hohh beon most 1111111911,
Outroged and troddon on, 11111119 doubt

If ho bo worm or no, moy answor for mo,

Asking of his own hoor'o what· brought him hero?
You know my 190911 story, all mon know 11,
And judgo of 11 far differently from those

Who 9919 in judgmont 10 hoap soorn on soom.

But sparo mo the moitol-it is hore,

Horo at my hoart, tho outrage-but my words,
Alroody spent in unavailing plaints,

Would only show my feoblenoss 1119 moro,

And Ι como horo 10 strongthon oven 1119 strong,
And urge thom on 10 doeds, and 101 10 war

With woman's woapons.
