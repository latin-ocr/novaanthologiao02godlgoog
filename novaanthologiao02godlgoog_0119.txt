‘So eareful oi the type‘?’ butue.

She eries, ‘A thousand types are gene:
I aare ior nothing, all shall go.

‘Thou makest thine appeal te me:
I bring te life, Ι bring to death:
The spirit does but mean the breath:

Man, her last work, who seem’d so fair,
Such splendid purpose in his eyes,
Who roll’d the psalm te wintry siries,

Who built him fanes oi fruitless prayer,

Who trusted God was love indeed
And love Orestion's final law-
rho’ Nature, red in tooth and elnw
With ravine, shriek'd against his ereed-

Who loved, who suffer’d eountless ilis,
Who battled for the True, the Just,
Be blown about the desert dust,

Or seal'd within the iren hilis?
