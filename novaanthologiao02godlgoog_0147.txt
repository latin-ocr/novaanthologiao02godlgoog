My terre, not gifts3 end like the poor, that mourn
With green but humble turio, write o’er his hearne
For false foul prose-men this fair truth in verse.
Here Daphnis strepet osod notite the great wotch goes
Of nuo aod resttess Time, tates tis reposo.

Fame is bnt κώεα att learning but a thought,

Which one admirer, another sets at neuoth·

Nature mocks boon aod wit still keeps ador:

But death brings knowledge aod assuranoe too.

Now entertein conjecture of a time
When oreeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide veesel of the universe.

From camp to comp, through the foul womb of night,

The hum of either army stilly soundn,

That the fix’d sentinols almost receive

The seoret whispers of eaoh other‘s watoh:

Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
anh battle sees the other‘s umber‘d face:

Steed threatens steed, in high end boastful neighs
Piereing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents
The armonem, aooomplishing the knights,

With busy hammers olosing riveto up,

Give dreadful note of preparation.
The country oooks do orow, the olooks do toll,

And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
