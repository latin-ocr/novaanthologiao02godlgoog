And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice
presided

Over the laws 61 the land, and the hea1ts and homes
of the people.

Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of
the balance,

Having no fear of the swerd that flashed in the sun·
shine above them.

But in the course 61 111116 the laws 61 the land were
corrupted;

Might took the place of right, and the weak were
oppressed, and the mighty

Ruled with an ivon rod. Then it chanced in a noble
man's palace

Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in 1116 household.

She, 61161 161111 61 trial condemned 16 die on 1116

Patiently met her doom at the 1661 61 the statue 61

As 16 her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,

Lol o’er 1116 citya tempest rose; and 1116 bolts 61 the
