'Phen I’ll look up ;
My fault is past. But, 01 what form of prayer
Gan serve my turn? ‘Forgive me my foul murder?'
That cannot be; since Ι am still possese’d
Of those effecte for which I did the murder,
My erown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be parden’d and retain the offenee?
In the corrupted currente of this world
Offenee's gssded hand may shore by justice,
And eft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law; but ’tis not so above ;
There is no shuffling, there the aetion lies

In his true nature* and we ourselves compell’d
Even te the teeth and forehead of eur faults
To give in evidenee. What then? What rests?

Try what repentanee ean: what ean it not?

Yet what ean it, when one ean not repent?

0 wretched state! 0 bosom blaek as death!

0 limed seul, that struggling te be free

Art more engaged! Help‚ angele! make aeeay3
Bow, stubborn kneeS, and heart with strIngs of eteel
Be eoft as ainews of the new-bern babe;

All may be welL
