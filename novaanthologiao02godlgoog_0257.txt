A 010011 long entry 10 the temple led,

Blind with high walls, and horror over head Í¾

As threatened from the hinge 10 heave the door.

The labour of 0 G0d3 and all along
Tough iren platee were elenehed 10 make 11 strong.

On the other eide there stood Destruetion bare,
Unpuniehed Rapine, and 0 waste ef war.

Loud meneees were heard, and foul disgraee,

And bawling infamy, in language base3

Till sense was 1001 in sound, end silence fied the pleee.
The slayer of himself yet saw I there,

The gere eengealed was clotted in hie hair3

With eyes half closed and geping mouth he lay,

And grim, 00 when he brenthed his sullen seul away.

DRYDEN.
