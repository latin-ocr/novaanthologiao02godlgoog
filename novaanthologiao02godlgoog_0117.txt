ANTHOLOGIA

LVIII

Loitering end leaping,

With menter, with bounde—
Fliekering end eireling

In filee and in rounds—

Geily their pinesteff green
Teesing in air,

Loose 0'er their shoulders white
Showering their hair—

See! the wild Maenade
Break from the wood, .
Youth and Iaeehus ¹
Maddening their blood!

See! through tho quiet land
Rioting they pase-

Fh'ng tho hesh heaps about,
Trample the grass!

Tear from the rified hedge
Gerlands, their prize:

Fill with their sporta the field,
Fill with their eries!

Shepherd, what ails thee hhen‘?
Shepherd, why mute?

Forth with thy joyous song}
Forth with thy fiutel

Tempts not the revel blithe?

Lure not their eries?
Glow nob their shoulders smooth‘?
