When the man wants weight the woman takes it up,
And topples down the scales ; but this is fixed

As are the roots of earth and base of all:

Mon for the field and women for the henrth:

Mon for the sword and for tho needle she:

Man with the head, and woman with the henrt:
Man to command and woman to obey:

All else confusion Look you! the gray mare

Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills

From tile to soullmy, and her small goodman
Shrinks in his arm-chain while the finos of Holl

Mix with his hearth: but yon-sho’s yet a colt-
Take, break her: strongly groom’d and straitly eurb’d
She might not rank with those detestable

That let tho bantling scald nt home, and brawl

Their rights or wrongs like potherbs in the street.
