ANTHOLOGIA

v11

These bad traditione of oomedy affeot us not only on
the stage, but in our literature, and may be traoked into
our soeial life. They are the ground of the heavy
moralizings by which we are outwoaried, about Life as
a Comedy, and (tomedy as a jado, when popular writers,
oonsoious ol fatigue in ereativeness, desire to be cogent in
a modish oynioism: perversione of the idea of life, and of
the proper esteem ior the soeiety we have wrested from
brutishness, and would oarry higher. Stook images of
this description are aooepted by the timid and sensitiva,
ae well as by the saturnine, quite seriously; for not
many look obruad with their own eyes, fewer still have
the habit of thinking for themselves. Life, we know too
well, is not a Comedy, but something strangely mixed;
nor is comedy a vile maele The oorrupted importation
from Franoe was noxious; a· noble entertainment spoilt
to suit the wretohed taste of a villainous age; and the
later imitatione of it, partly drained of its poison and
made deeorous, beoume tiresome, notwithstanding their

fun, in the perpetual recurring of the same situations,
owing to the absence of original study and vigour ol
conception.
