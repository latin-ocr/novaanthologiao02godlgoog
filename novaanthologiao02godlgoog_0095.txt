XLVI

My great love
Sprang up redoubled, and eost out my hate
And spurned all thought of fear3 und down the stair
I hurried, and upon the bleeding form
I threw myself, and raised his head, and olosped
His body to mine, ond kissed him on the lips,
And in his dying ear confessed my wrong,
And saw the horror in his dying eyes,
And knew thet I wne damned And when he breathed
His leet pure breath, I rose and slowly spoke-
Turned to a Fury now by love and pein-
Το the old man who knelt, while ull the throng
Could hear my secret: ‘See thou fool, I om

The murderess of thy son, and thou my dupe,

Thou and thy gods. See, he was innoeent;

I murdered him for love. I seorn ye all,

Thee end thy gods together, who are deceived

By a woman’s lying tongue! Oh, doting fool,

To hate thy own! And ye, false powers, which punish
The innocent, and let the guilty soul

Esoepe unsoathed, I hate ye all-I ourse,

I loethe you !'
