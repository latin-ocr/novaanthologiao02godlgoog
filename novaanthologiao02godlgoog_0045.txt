0 lyrio love, half-angel and half-bird

’ And alla wonder and a wild desire,-

Boldeei 01 hearis 11101 ever brayed 1110 sun,

Took sanctuary within the holier blue,

And sang a kindred soul out 10 his face,-

Yet human at the red-ripe 011110 heari—

When the first 'summons from the darkling 001111
Reached thee amid thy chambere, blanched their blue,
And bared thom 01 their glory-to drop down,

To 1011 for man, 10 suffer or 10 die,—

This is the same voice: can thy eoul know change?
Hail then, and hearken from the realme 01 help!
Never may I commoneo my song, my due ,

'l'o God who best taught song by gift 01 thee,
Except with beni head and bescoching hand—

'I'hat still, despite the distance and the derk,

What was, again may be: some interchange

01 grace, some splendour once chy very thought,
Some benediction ancicnily thy smile:

—Never conclude, but raising hand and head
Thither where eyes, that cannot reaeh, yet yearn
For all hope, all susieinment, all reward,

Their utmoet, up and on,-so bleesing back

In those thy realme 01 help, that heaven thy home,
Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,

Some wanness where, 1 think, thy 1001 may fall!
Bnowlwwo.
