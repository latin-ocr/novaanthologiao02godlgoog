Now on the summit of Love’s topmost peak
Kios we and part; no farther ean we go:
And better death than we from high to low
Should dwindle or decline from strong to weak.
We have found all, there is no moreto seek ;
All have we proved, no more is there to know3
And Timo oould only tutor us to eke
Out rapturo's warmth with eustom's after-glow.
We cannot keep at such a height as this;
And even straining souls like oure inhale
But once in life so rarefied a bliss.

» What if we lingered till love's breath should fail!
Heaven of my earth! one more celestial kiss,
Thon down by separate pathways to the vale.

A· husam.

CXIV

Let golden youth bewail the friend, the wife,
For ever gone ;

He thinks of that long wall< thro’ desert life
Without the one.

The silver year should oease to mourn and sigh—
Not long to wait-

So close are we, dear Mary, you and I,
To that dim gato.

Take, read! and be the faults your poet makes
Or many or few,

He rests content, if his young musio wakes
A wish in you

To change our dark Queenoity, all her realm
Of sound and smoke,

For his clear heaven, and these few lanes of olm

And whispering oak

naamon.
