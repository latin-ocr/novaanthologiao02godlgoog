How happy is he born end taught

Thut serveth not another's will;
Whose ermour is his honest thought,
And simple truth his utmost skill3

Whose passione not his masters ure3
Whose soul is still prepared for death,
Untied unto the world by oare
Of publio ieme or private breath;

Who envies none that chance doth reise,
Nor vioe3 who never understood

How deepest wounds are given by preise;
Nor rules of state, but rules of good3

Who heth his life from rumours freed;

Whose eonscienoe is his strong retreat3
Whose state oon neither flatteiers foed,
Nor ruin make oppressors great 3

Who God doth late und early pray
More of his graue than gifts to lend ;
And entertuins the harmless day
With a religious book or friend.

This man is heed from servile bands
Of hope to rise or feei· to fall:
Lord of himself, though not of lends,

And, having nothing, yet heth ull.
