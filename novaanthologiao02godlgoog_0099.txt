XLVIII

Garat. O! to what purpose dost thou hoard thy
words,
That thou return’st no greeting to thy friends?
Boitap. Ι have too few to take my leave of you,
When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
Το breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
Gaant. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Boliap. J oy absent, grief is present for that time.
(iacnt. What is six wintere? they are quickly gone.
Boliap. To men in joy3 but grief makes one honr
ten.
(iacnt. Call it a trave] that thou tak’st for pleasure.
Boliap. My heart will sigh when I missali it sc,
Which finds itan enforoed pilgrimage.
Garat. The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem a foil wherein thou art to set
The precisus jewel of thy home return.

Boiiap. Nay‚ rather, every tedicus stride Ι make
Will but remember me what a deal of world

I wander from the jewels that I love.

Must I not serve a long apprenticehood

To foreign passages, and in the end,

Having my freedom, boast of nothing else

But that I was a journeyman to grief?
Garat. All places that the eye of heaven visits

Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.

Teaeh thy necessity to reason thus3

There is no virtue like necessity.

Think not the king did banish thee,

But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,

Where it pereeives it is but faintly borne.
