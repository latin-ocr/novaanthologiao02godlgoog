B. The fire takes.

0. It does so,
But no flame risos. Oease your fretful prayers,
Your whiniug5‚ and your tame petitione.
The gods love oourage armed with confidendo,
And praysrs fit to pull them down ; weak tears
And troubled hearts, the dull twins of oold spirits,
They sit and smile at. Hear how I salute 'em.
Divino Andate, thou who hold’st the reins
Of furious battles and disordered war,
And proudly roll’st thy swarty ohariotwheels
Over the heaps of wounds and caroaseS,
Sailing through seas of blood3 thou sure-steeled stern-

nass,

Give us this day good hearts, good onomius,
Good blows o’ both sides, wounds that fear or flight
Can claim no share in: steel us both with angers
And warlike executione fit thy viewing3
Let Rome put 011 her best strength, and thy Britain,
Thy little Britain, but as great iu fortune,
Meet her es strong as she, as proud‚ as during!
And then look on, thou redeyed god! who does best,

Reward with honour; who despair makes fly,

Unarm for ever, and brand with infamyi
BEAUBONT ANB FLE'NHEB·
