O’er the smooih enamelled green,
Whene no print of step halh been,
Follow me, aa 1 sing
And toueh the warbled string,
Under the shady roof
of branohing elm star-proofi
Follow me;

I will bring you where she sits,
ulad in splendour as befihs
Her deity.

Suoh a rural queen
All Arcadia 1111111 not seen.

Nymphs and shepherds, danoe no more
By sandy Ladon’s lilied banks3
011 old Lycaeus, or Cyllene hoar‚
Trip no more in twilight ranks3
Γ[11011311 Erymanth your loss deploro,
A better soil shall give ye thanks.
From the stony Maenalus
Bring your fiooks and live with us;
Here ye shall have greater grace,
no serve the lady of this place.
Though Syrinx your Pan’s mistress were,
Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.
Such a rural queen
All Aroadia hath not seen.
