Q. Mor. Oi let me entreat thee, oeasei Give me
thy hand,
'Phat Ι may dew it with my mourniul teors3
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this plaoe,

'Po wash away my woeful monuments.
01 eould this kiss be printed in thy hand,

That thou mightst think upon those by the seal,
Through whom a thousand sighs are breath’d for thee.
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief ;

'Tio but surmis’d whiles thou art standing by,

As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
I wssl repeol thee, or, bo well assur'd,

Adventure to bo banished myself;

And ba‘nished Ι am, if but from thee.

(403 speak notio me; even now bo gone.

01 go not yet. Even thus two friends condemn’d
Embraoe and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,
Loathera hundred times to part than die.

Yet now forewell; and farewell life with thee!
Sos. Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished‚
Onoe by the king, and three times thriee by thee.
’ris not the land Ι care for, wert thou thenoe 3

A wilderness ie populous enough,

So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:

For where thou art, there is the world itself,
With every several pleasure in the world,
And where thou art not, desolation.

Ι ean no more: live thou to joy thy life;
Myself to joy in nought hut that thou liv'st.
