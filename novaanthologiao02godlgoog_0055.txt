ANTHOLOGIA

XXIV

Low, like another's, lies lhe leurelled head:

The life that seemed a perfeci song is 0’er:
Gany the lest great hard to his last bed.

Land that he loved‚ thy noblesh voice is mute.
hand that he loved, that loved himl nevermore
Meadow of thine, smoolh lawn or wild senshore,
Gardens of odorous bloom and tremulous fruit,
Or woodlands old, like Druid couches spread,
'Phe master's feet shall tread.

Dealh’s little rift hnlh rent the faultless lute:
The singen of undying songs is dead.

Le, in this sesson pensive-hued and grave,
While fades and falls the doomed‚ relueleni leaf
From withered Esrlh’s fantasiis coronal,

with wandering sighs of forest and of wave
Mingles lhe murmur of a people's grief

For him whose leaf shall fede not, neither fall
He hath sared forth, beyond lhese suns and showers.

Ferus, tho autumn glovi, the autumn flame,
And soon the winter silence shall be oure:
Him the eternel spring of fadeless fame

Orowns with no morial flowers.
W. wmon.
