Me an' thy muther, Sammy, ’as boun assalkin' 0’ th003

Thou ’s bean talkin’ to muther, an' she bean a tellin’
it me.

Thou ’11 not marry for munny-thou 's swoet upo' parson's

Noa—thou'll marry for luvv—an' we boflth 011 us thinks
thaan ass.

Seefi’d her todany goti by-Saitint'ffdwy—they was
ringing the bella.

She ’s a beauty thou thinks—an‘ soii is scoors 0' golls,

'Phem as 'as munny an' all-wot ’s beauty‘2-the flower
as blaws.

But proputty, proputty sticks, an' proputty, proputty
graws.

Do’ant¹ be stunt: taake time: I knaws what mankes
tha sa mad.

Warn't I oraazed fur the lassos mys6n when I wur a lad?

But I knaw’d a Quaiiker feller as often 'as towd ma this:

‘Dofint thou marry for munny‚but gofiwheor munny is !’

An’ Ι went wheer munny war: an' thy muther coom
to 'and‚

Wi' lots 0’ munny laatd by, an' a nicetish bit 0’ land.

Maiiybe she warn't a beauty:—I niver giv it a thowt-

But warn'b she as good to cuddle an' kiss as a lass as
'ant nowt?

Luvv? whab's luvv? thou can luvv thy lass an' ’er
munny too,

Maakin' 'em goa togither as they've good right to do.

Oould'n I luvv thy muther by cause 0’ 'er munny
laaId by?

Nassy-fur I luvv'd 'or a vast sight moor fur it:
reason why. ’
