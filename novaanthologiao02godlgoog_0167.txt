0 lady, leave thy silken thread
And flowery tapeslrie;

There 's living reses on the bush,
And bloeeome on the treet

Sloop where thou wilt, thy earelees hand
Some random bud will meet ;

Thou cenet not head, but thou wilt find
The daisy at thy feet.

’ris like the birthdey of the world,
When earth was born in bleom;

The light is made of many dyee,
The air ie all perlum03

There 'e erimson bude, and while end blue-
The very rainbow ehowers

Have hurn’d to bloseome where they fell,
And eown the earth wilh flowere

There 'e fairy tulipe in the east,
The garden of the eun;

The very streame refiert the haee,
And bloesome as they run:

While Morn opes like a erimson rose,
still wel with pearly ehowere 3

Then, lady, leave the eilhen thread
Thou twineet into flowerel
