LXVI

All are not just, because they do no wrong,

But he, who will not wrong me when he may,
He is the truly just. Ipraise not them,

Who in their petty dealings pilfer not;

But him, whose conscience spurns a secret fraud,
When he might plunder and defy surprise:

His be the praise, who looking down with scorn
On the false judgement of the partiat herd,
Consults his own clear heart, and boldly dares

To be, not to be thought, an honest man.

LXVII

Now fades the last long streslr of sn0w‚
Now burgeons every maze of quick
About the flowering equares, and thick

By ashon roots the violets blow.

Now rings the woodland loud and long,
The distance takes a lovelier hue,
And drown’d in yonder living blue

The lark becomes a sightless song.

Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,
The fiocks are whiter down the vale,
And milkier every milky scil

On winding stream or distant sea;

thre now the seamew pipes, or dives

In yonder greening gleam, and fly

The happy birds, that change their sky
Το build and brood; that live their lives

From land to land3 and in my bresst
Spring wahens too; and my regret

Becomes an April violet,
And buds and blossoms like the rest. rnnnvsor.
