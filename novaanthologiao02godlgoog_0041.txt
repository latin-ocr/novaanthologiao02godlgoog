1111
Kath. Pie, fie 1 1111111111 that threatening unkind brow,

And (11111 not scornful glauces from those eyeS,

Το wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:

11 blots thy beauty as frosts do bite 111111111αό11,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buda, Α

And in no sense is meet or amiable.

Α woman mov’d is like a fountain 1101111911,
Muddy, ill-seeming‚ thick, bereft of beauty3

And while 11 is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will doign to sip or touch one drop of 11. ,

Thy husband is thy lord‚ thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign3 qne 111111 cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commite his body

Το painful labour both by soa and land,

To watch the night 111 storms, 11111 day in oold,
Whilst thou liest warm 111 home, secure and saf03
And craves no other tribute at thy hands

But love, fair looks, and true obedience ;

Τοο little payment for so great a debu

smmum.
