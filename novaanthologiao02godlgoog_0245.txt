. [Should all our ohurohmen foam in spite

At you, eo eareful of the rig t,
Yet one lay-heoruh would give you weloome]

(Tele it and come) to the Iele of Wight3

where, far from noise and smoke of town,
I wetoh lhe twilight falling brown

All round u careless-order'd gurden
Olose to the ridge of a noble down.

You'll have no seandal while you dine,
But honest talk and wholesome wine,
And only hear the mugpie gossip

Garruloue under a roof of pinet ยน

For grovee of pine 011 either hand,

'Po break the bloet of winter, stand3
And further 011, the homy Channel
Tumbles a hillow on ohelk and sund3

Where, 11 below 1110 milky steep
Some ehip of battle slowly creep,

And on thro' zones of light und shudow
Glimmer away to the lonely deep,

We might disouss the Norlhern sin
Which made a eelfieh war begin3

[Dispute the olaims, arrange the ohunoes3

Emperor, Otloman, which ehull win]
