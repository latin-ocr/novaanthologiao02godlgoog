But wherefore do nol you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody lyrani, Time?
And fortify yourself in your deoay
With means more bleesed than my barren rime?
Now stand you on the top of happy houm,
And many maiden gurdone, yet unsel,
With wirtuous wish would bear you living fiowers
Muoh liker than your painted counierfeil:
So should the lines of life that life repen,
Which this, Time’s penul, or my pupil pen,
Neilher in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.

Το give away yourself keeps yourself still3

And you musi live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

Weary wilh lod, I haste me to my bed,

The dear reposo for limbs with lravel tired3

But then begins a journey in my head

To work my mind, when body's work ’s expir'd:
For then my thoughts-from far where I abide-
Inlend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,

And keep my drooping eyelide open wide,
Looking on darkness which the blind do seo:
Save thar my eoul’s imaginary sight

Presente thy ehadow lo my sighllees view
Which, like a jewel hung in ghaetly night,
Makes blaok night beauleous and her old faoe new.

Lol thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
For thee and for myself no quiet find.
