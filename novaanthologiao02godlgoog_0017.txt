Come down, O naid, from yonder mountain height:

What pleosure lives in height? (the shepherd sang)

Ι , In height and oold, the splendour of the hills?

But cesse to move so near the heavens, end oense
To glide s sunbeam by the blosted pine,
‘l'o sit s ster upon the sparkling spire:
And come, for Love is of the rehey, come,
For Love is of the valley, come thou down
And find him 3 by tho happy threshold he,
Or hond in hand with Plenty in the maizo,
Or red with spirted purple of the vete,
Or foxlike in the vine 3 nor oares to welk
With Death and Morning on the silver horne:
Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,
Nor find him dropped upon the firths of ioe,
Thst huddling slant in furrow-oloven falls
To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:
- But follow: let the torrent denos thee down
To find him in the velloy: let the wild
Leon-headed eagles yelp alone, and leave
The monstrous ledges there to slope and spill
Their thousand wreethes of dengling water-smoke‚
That like a broken purpose waste in air:
So waste not thou: but oome; for all the vele
Awaits thee: szure pillors of the heerth
Arise to thee: and children call, and Ι
Thy shepherd pipo, and sweet is every sound:
