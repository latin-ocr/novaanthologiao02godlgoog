LXXXIV

K. Edw. Ah, Leioester, weigh how hardly Ι uun brook
Το lose my orown ond kingdom without cause3
To give ambitious Mortimer my right,
That like a mountain overwhelms my bliss‚
In which extremes my mind here murdered is
But what the heavens appoint, I must obeyt
Here, take my orown; the life of Edward t003
Two kings in Englund cannot reign at once.
But stay awhile‚ let me be king till night,
Thet Ι may gaze upon this glittering orown3

So shall my eyes receive their lust content,
My head, the latest honour due to it,

And jointly both yield up their wished right.

Continuo ever, thou celestia] sun ;

Let never silent night possess this olime:
Stund still, you watches of the element;

All times and sessons, rest you at a stay,
That Edward may be still fair Englund’s king!
But duy’s bright bearn doth vanish fast away,
And needs Ι must resign my wished orown
Inhuman creaturos! nursed with tiger’s milk!
Why gape you for your sovereign's overthrow?
My diadem I mean, und guiltless life.

See, munstero, see, I'll wear my orown again!
umowu.
