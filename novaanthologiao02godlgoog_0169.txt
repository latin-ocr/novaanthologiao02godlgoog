101

(iol-thou md all unfit to share
The pleasures of this plaee

With such as its old tonante are,
Oreatures of geniler rade.

The squirrel here his heard provides,
Aware of wintry storms;

And woodpeekers explere the sides
Of rugged oaks for worma

The sheep here smoothes the knotted thorn
with frictione of her fleeee;

And here I wander eve and morn,
Like her, a fn'end to peace.

. Ah 1-I could pity the exiled

From this secure retreat ;-

Ι would not lose it te be styled
The happiesi of the great.

But thou canei taste no calm delight3
Thy pleasure is to show

Thy magnanimity in fight,
Thy promsi-therefore, goi

I eare not whether east or north,
So Ι no more may find thee3

The angiy Muse thus sings thee forth,
And elaps the gato behind thee.
