Willing 10 wound, and yet afraid to strike,
Just hint a 101111, and hesitete dislike;

Alike reserved 10 blame, or to commend,

A timorous 100, and a suspicious friend3
Dreeding even fools, by flatterers besieged,
And so obliging, that he ne'er obliged3

Like Octo, give his little Senate laws.

And sit attentive to his own applause3
While wits end templers ev'ry sentence mise,

And wonder with a foolish fece 0101111001-
Who but must laugh, if such 0 man there be?

Who would 1101 weep if Atticus were he? m

Ηο esked, but 011 the heavenly quire stood mute,
And silence was in Hoeven: 011 Man’s behalf
Patron or intercessor none appeared—
Much less that duret upon his own head drew
The deadly forfeiture, end ransom set.
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have been lost, adjudged to Death ond Hell
By doom severe, hod not the Son 01 God,
In whom the fulness dwells oi love divine,
His dearest mediation thus renewed :-

‘Fathen thy word is passed, Man sholl find grace;
And shall Gracc not find means, thet finds 1101 wey,
The speediest 01 thy winged messengers,

To visit all thy oreatures, and to all

Comes unprevented, unimplored, unsoughtl'
