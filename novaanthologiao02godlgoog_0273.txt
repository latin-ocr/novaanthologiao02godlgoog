No forest fell
When thou wouldat build3 no quarry eent its stores

'l'o enrioh thy walls: but thou didst hew the floods,
And make thy marble of the glassy wave.

In euch a palaoe Aristaeus found

Cyrene, when he bore the plnintive tale

of his lost bees to her maternal ear.

In such a palaoe Poetry might plaoe

'Phe armoury of winton where his troops,

'Phe gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,
Skinpieroing volley, bloseom·bruising hail.

Silently ae a dream the fabrio rose3

No sound of hammer· or of saw was there:

Ioe upon ioe, the well-adjusted parte

Were soon oonjoined‚ nor other oement askod

Than water inter-fused to make them one.

Lampe graoefully diepoeed, and of all haee,
Illumined every side: a watery light

Gleamed through the clear transparenoy‚ that eeemed
Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen

From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.

OOWPER.
