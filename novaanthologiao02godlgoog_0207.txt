CXX

Let me confess thet we two must be luein,
Although our undivided loves ere one:

So shall those blots that do with me romain,
Without thy help, hy me be borne alone.

In our two loves there is but one respect,

Though in our lives a sepereble spite,
Which, though it alternet love's sole effect,

Yet doth it steel sweet hours from love's delight.
Ι may not evermero aeknowledge thee,
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame‚
Nor thou with publio kindness honour me,
Unless thou take that honour from thy neme:
But do not so; Ι love thee in such sort
As thou being mine, mine is thy good repert.

CXXI

This world ie ell a fleeting show
For man's illusion given:
The smiles 01 J oy, the teers of Woe‚
Deeeitful shine‚ deeeitful 11011,-
There ’s nothing true, but Hoeven!
And false the light on Glory's plume,
As feding hues 01 even:
And Leve and Hope end Beeuty’s bloom
Are blossoms gether’d 101 the tomb-
There 's nothing bright‚ but Heaven.
Poor wanderers of a stormy day!
From weve to weve we're driven,
And Faney's fleeh end Reeson’s rey
Serve but to light the troubled wey-

There 's nothing calm, but Hoeven!
HOORE.
