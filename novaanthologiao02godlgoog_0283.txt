CLXXII

He was my friend, the truesf friend on earih;
A strong and mighiy influenoe join'd our birih3
Nor did wo envy the mosi sounding name

By friendship giv’n of old io fame.

None but hie brothren he, end sisiers knew,
Whom the kind youth preferr’d io me ;
And ev'n in that we did agree,

For much above myself I lov'd thom too.

Say, for you saw ue, ye immortal lignos,
How oft unwearied have we spent the nighis?
Till the Ledaean stare, so fem'd for love,
Wondered ai ue from above.
We spent them noi in toys, in lusis, or wine;
But search of deep philosophy,
wit, eloquenoe, and poeiry,
Aris which I lov’d, for they, my friend, were thino.

CLXXIII

Under the wide end etarry sky

Dig the grave and let me lie;

Glad did I live and glodly dio,
And Ι leid me down with a will.

This be the verse you grave for me:

‘Here he lies where ho longed io be ;

Home is the soilor, home from eea,
And ihe hunter home from the hill)
