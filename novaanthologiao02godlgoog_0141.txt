She gleans her silvan trophies; down 1116 wold
She hears 1116 sobbing 611116 stage thathee
Mixed with 1116 musio 61 the hunting roll'd.

And through 1116 dim wood Dian 11116616 her way.

111666. Take then 1116 worst in brief, Samson is dead.
Mesoa. The worst indeed; Ο 611 my hopes defeated
'l'o 1166 him hence! but Death, who 6616 all 1166,
Η6111 paid his ransom now and full discharge.
What windy joy this day had I aonaeiv'd,
Hopeful 61 his delivery, whieh now proves
Abortive as 1116 firshborn bloom 61 spring
Nipt with 1116 lagging rear 61 winter's 116611
Yet, ere I give 1116 161116 16 grief, say 11161,
How died he? death 1ο life is erown or shame.
All by him fell, thou say‘st3 by whom fell he?
What glorious hand gave Samson his death’s wound?
111666. Unwounded 61 his enemies he fell.
Mea. Wearied with slaughher then, or how? explain
Meso. By his own hands.
