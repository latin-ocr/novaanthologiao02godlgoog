Sir Riohord epoke end he longh’d and we roor'd

6 hurrah, ond 66

‘Phe little Revenge ran 66 sheer into the henrt 61 the
foe,

With her hundred fighters on deolr, and her ninety
siek below 3

For half of their fleet 16 the right and half to the left
were seen,

And the little Revenge ran on thro' the long 666-1666
between.

Thoueande of their soldiere look’d down from their
deolrs and lough’d,

Thousands of their seemen made moek 61 the mod
little craft

Running on ond on, till delay'd

By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen
hundred tone,

And upshadowing high above 66 with her yawning
tieret of guno,

'Pook the breath from our 66116, ond we stoy'd.

And while now the great San Philip hung above 66
like 6 cloud

Whenee the thnnderbolt will fall

Long end loud,

Four galleons drew away

From the Spanish fleet thet day,

And two upon the larboard and two upon the storboord
lay,

And the battlethunder broke from them all.

But angon the great San Philip, she bethought herself
’ 66 went
