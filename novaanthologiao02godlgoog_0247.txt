Belter to weit:

Tho wiso men wail3 it is the foolish haste,
And ere the soenes are in the elides would play,
And while the instrumento are derling, donee.

1· see Napoleon on the heights intent

Το arroso thot one boios unii of loooo time

Which hands high Victory’s thread3 his marshals fret,
His soldiers olamour low: the very guns

Seem going off themselves3 the cannen sirain

Like hell-dogs in the leosh. But he, he waits3

And leesor chaneos and inferior hopes

Meontime go pouring past.

CXLVIII

Drink to me only wilh thino eyes,
And 1 will pledge with min03

Or leave a kiss but in the eup,
And I’ll not look for wine.

The thirsi that from the soul dolh riso
Doth ask a drink divine:

But might Ι of J ovo’s nector sup,
I would not change for thino.
