Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
Nightswollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad -
Sickens our fearlul ewes3 and we have had

Great bounty from Endymion our lord.’

ow
Oreine, noble sir,

Be pleaa’d that Ι shake off these names you give me:
Antonio never yet was thief 01 pirate,

¹ Though Ι confess, on base and ground enough,

Orsino’s enemy. A witohcraft drew me hither:
'Phat most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth
Did Ι redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
His life Ι gave him, and did 11101010 add

My love, without retention or restraint,

All his in dedication3 for his sake

Did I expose myself, pure for his love,

Into the danger 01 this adverse town ;

Drsw to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out 01 his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink.

ammana.
