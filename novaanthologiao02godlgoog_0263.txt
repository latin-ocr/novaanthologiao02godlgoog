Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story!
The days 61 666 youth arethe days of our glory3
And the myrtle and ivy of sweet twoandtwenty
Are worth all your laureis, though everso plenty.

What are garlanda and crowns to the brow that is
wrinkied'?
”Iis but as a dead flower with Maydew besprinkled.

Thon away with all such from the head that is hoary!
What rare I for the wreaths that ean only give glory!

Oh Fame! ier'er took deh‘ght in thy praises,
'Twas 1666 166 the sake of thy high-sounding phrases
Than to 666 the bright eyes of the dear One discover
She thought that I was not unworthy 16 love her.

There chiefly Ι sought thee, there only I found thee3
Her glanae was the best of the rays that surround thee ;
When it sparkled o’er ought that was bright in my story,

I knew it was iove, and I felt it was glory.
BYBON.

Hero, when that he oame not, watched all night,
Into the darkness straining hard her sight3
And morning breaking and no sign of him,
With aohing heart she scanned the sea-iaco dim,

Fearing to look because that lamp went out
He was not there, but easting all about,
Lo, at the turret’s foot his body lay,

Rolled on the stonee, and soaked with breaking spray.

She rent hor robe upon her, and leapod down
Headlong, distraoted, from the turret’s orown ;
There on his oorpse she breathed her dying breath,
And linked in life, those two were one in death.
