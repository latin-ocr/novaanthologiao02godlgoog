Tell me, ye studious, who pretend 10 888

Far into nature’s bosom, whence the bea

Was first inform’d her venturous flight to 81881
'through truekless paths and an abyss of air:
Whenoe she avoids the slimy marsh and knows
une fertile hilis, where sweeter herbage grows
And honey·making flowers their opening buds disolose:
How from 1118 thioken’d mist and setting sun
linds she the labour of her day is done?

Who taught her against winds and rains to strive,
To bring her burden to 1118 88118111 11118,

And through 1118 liquid fields again to pass,
Duteous and heerkening to 1118 sounding bross?
And, Ο thou sluggard, tell me why the ant,
’Midst summer’s plenty, thinks 01 winter’s want,
By constant journeys oareful to prepare

Her stores 3 and bringing home the eorny aar,
By what instruction does she bite the grain,

Lest, hid in earth and taking root again,

It might elude the foresight of her aare?

Distinet in all the inseot's deeds appear

The marks of thought, oontrivanoe, hope and sear.

Yes‚ ’118 the eternal law that where guilt is

Sorrow shall answer it: and thou hast not
A poor man’s privilege to bear alone,

Or in the narrow⁸oirole of his kinsmen,
The penalties 81 evil, 101 in thino

A nation’s fate lies oireled. King Adrastus!
