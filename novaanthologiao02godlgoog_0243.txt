Time wasteth yeares ond months and hours:

Time doth consume fame, honour, will, and strength:
Time kille the greeneet herbs and sweeteet flowers:
Time weoree out youth and beautie’e lookee ah length:

Time doth eonvey to ground both foe and friend,
And eeoh thing els but Love, which heth no end.

This said, he left them, and returned no more.—
But rumours hung about the country-eide,
rhet the lost scholar long was seen to etrry,
Seen by rere glimpsee pensive and tonguedied,
In hat of antique shnpe, and olodk of gwy,
The same the gipsies wore.

Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;
At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,
On rho werm ingleboneh, the emoch-hooked boors

And I myeelf seem half to know thy looks,

And put the ehepherde wanderer, on thy traoe;
And boys who in lone wheatfields scere the rooke

Ι ask if thou hast passed their quiet plaee3

Or in my boat I lie

Moored ho the oool bank in the summer heato,

Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fille,

And wotoh the worm green-muffied Oumnor hille,
And wonder if thou haunt’et their shy retreate
