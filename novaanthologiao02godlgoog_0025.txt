Ι will not leave the smouldering pyro:
Enough remains to light again:

But who am I iddare desire
A place beside the king of men?

So burnt my dear Oechalian town3
And I an outoast gazed and groaned.

Bul, when my falher’s roof fell down,
For all that wrong sweet love atoned.

He led me trembling to the ship,
He seemed at last to love me lhen3
He soothed, he elasped me lip to lip:
How strange, to wed the king of men!

Ι linger, orphan, widow, slave 3
I lived when sire and brelhren died.
Oh, had l shared my mother's grave,
Or olomb unio the hero’s side!

That comrade old halh made his moan ;
The oentaur eowers within his den:

And Ι abide lo guard alone
The ashes of the king of men.

Alone, benealh the night divine—
Alone, another weeps elsewhere:
Her love for him is unlike mine,

Her wail she will not let me share.
W. Jomlson.
