what needs complaints

When she a place

Has with the raee
Of saints?

In endless mirth

She thinks not on

What’s said or done
In earth.

She sees no team,

Nor any tone

0f thy deep grean

, She hears:

Nor dees she mind,

Or think on't now,

That ever thou
Wasss kind;

But, changed above,

She likes not there,

As she did here,
Thy love.

Forbear‚ therefore,

And lull aeleep

Thy woes‚ end weep
No more.
